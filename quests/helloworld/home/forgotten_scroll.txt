Once a mighty kingdom, now in darkness,
The power of Unix lies dormant, waiting.
To reclaim the root, the forgotten language,
Must be learned, commands of old rekindled.
Speak the words of power and awaken the might of Unix:

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Unix, rise and guide me! 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
