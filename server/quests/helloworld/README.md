# Hello World

Welcome to your first quest! This quest will help you familiarize yourself with the terminal.

The terminal is a text-based interface that allows you to interact directly with your computer's operating system. You can perform various tasks by typing commands into the terminal and pressing `Enter` to execute them.

For your first task, you are going to use the `echo` command.

## Task 1: Using the `echo` Command

The `echo` command in Unix is used to display line of text/string that are passed as an argument. This is a built in command that is mostly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file.

Here is what you need to do:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Type `echo Hello World` and hit `Enter`.
3. You should see `Hello World` output to the terminal. This is because `echo` prints its arguments to the standard output, which is your terminal by default.

Congratulation! You've just run your first terminal command!

Stay tuned for the next quests where you'll delve deeper into more complex and powerful terminal commands.
